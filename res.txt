======== Test 1: change current directory  ========
cwd:/
change current directory to ./RAMDISK0
cwd:/RAMDISK0

======== Test 2: write/read file by relative path  ========
write: ./ramfile
file descriptor fd: 0
write content: 
hello world
read: ./ramfile
read content: 
hello world

======== Test 3: Go to parent directory  ========
